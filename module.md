Name: Otavio Silva

## Part 1 - Module Planning

Development of a software implementing Cloud Database. 
To-Do App

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? - Sprint 1

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |       x       |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

* You must create a database using a cloud service for your program to use including at least one table to store data into.

* Your software must demonstrate the ability to insert, modify, delete, and retrieve (or query) data.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material? 
Firebase/MongoDB documentation, Youtube, ChatGpt

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software? -
Read documentation to understand the basics on developing with it for my requirements, watch youtube videos about that being applied in different cases, code along with videos (if I find useful content), and then start the development.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)? 
A to-do app using cloud database (Firebase or MongoDB)

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
Monday-Saturday, during night-time, with specific hours varying, but some time between 06:00pm and 1:30am. It will change depending on priority on other classes and this one.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
Technical - Not be able to finish the app
Behavioral - Worry too much about everything I need to do and end-up sabotaging myself.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                      |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------     |-------------|

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
